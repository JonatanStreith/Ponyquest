Mostly by you, but Starlight and Twilight appears to have made their own contributions as well. Not by permission.\n\nTELEKINESIS: The ability to move and manipulate physical objects by magic. Any unicorn can do this. It's so basic, it hardly bears mention.\n\nTELEPORT: Transport yourself or other things to any place you can imagine. Extremely useful! Only very capable unicorns can do it. \n[Just don't lose your concentration and we won't have any more mistakes, okay? -SG]\n[I'm actually impressed. Good work! -TS]\n\nTEACUPIFY: Turn things into teacups!\n[And other things, Trixie. Not just teacups. Please stop fixating on teacups, for the love of Celestia! -SG]\n\nENERGIZE: Infuses objects with raw magic energy. Magical artifacts and devices often require a source of magic in order to work properly.\n\nFIREWORKS: Fires lights and harmless explosions into the sky, to dazzle and amaze. Trixie's favorite spell!\n\nCLOUDWALK: Bestows the ability to walk on clouds the way pegasi can. Can be cast on self or others. Probably very useful.\n[It's got a limited duration, so recast it if you need to stay up for a longer time. -TS]\n\nWINGS SPELL: Creates beautiful butterfly wings imbued with real flight ability. TRIXIE MUST LEARN THIS SPELL. The performance possibilities are literally endless. Twilight says it takes a lot of magic, but she's probably exaggerating.\n[Those wings are really fragile and sensitive to heat, though. You need to be careful. -SG]\n[Starlight, teach Trixie a slowfall spell and make sure she gets it. I don't trust her to be 'careful'. -TS]\n\nWANT IT, NEED IT: Causes anypony who sees the targeted object to become enormously infatuated\/obsessed with it. Very useful!\n[No, no, no, no, NO. Absolutely not! -TS]\n\nFIREBALL: Launches a ball of fire at a target, damaging it and setting it on fire. Possible substitute for fireworks. Note: Promised Starlight only to use this for good.\n[Just remember that assault is a crime, okay? -TS]\n\nSLEEP: Puts target to sleep for a while. Useful if they're causing trouble, or in case of insomnia.\n[Good, good, use this instead of setting ponies on fire, okay? -TS]\n\nBODYSWAP: Exchanges bodies - or minds - with the target. Starlight wants me to remember that if I swap bodies with a non-unicorn, I can't cast the spell to turn back. Good point.\n[If you're going to do this, make sure your 'target' is informed and consenting, okay? Identity theft is also a crime. -TS]\n\nDISINTEGRATE: Utterly destroys a thing. Good for getting rid of things I don't need anymore, like garbage. Doesn't work on living things, which is for the best.\n[Just... don't break stuff that doesn't belong to you, okay? The teacups were bad enough. -SG]"}},{"RelationCore":{"OwnerId":null,"DefaultLocation":"Location_Castle_Library","Location":"Location_Castle_Library"},"IdentityCore":{"Descriptions":{"default":"It's a cape imbued with an invisibility spell.
